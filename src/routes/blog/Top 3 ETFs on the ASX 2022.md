There is no doubt that ETF investing is one of the most simple and effective investment strategies out there. ETFs make it easy for investors to mirror the performance of an index without the headache of manually rebalancing potentially thousands of securities on a regular basis.

However, the extreme diversity of ETFs out there can cause extreme decision fatigue when deciding which ones to invest in. This list is in no particular order although, each ETF has been selected based on the following criteria:

- Diversity
- Growth potential
- Key benefits and drawbacks
- Track record
- Management fee

_These are my personal picks for the top 3 ETFs on the ASX. They are not the best performing ETFs by any means but rather, a diverse set of ETFs that each provide their own unique value to a portfolio. This article does not constitute financial advice and everyone should do their own research. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, I would love to hear them in the comments below._

## BetaShares Diversified All Growth ETF (DHHF)

| Net Assets (AUD) | Returns Since Inception (p.a.) | Management Fee |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| $143,920,000     | 11.4%                          | 0.19%          |

> DHHF aims to provide low-cost exposure to a diversified portfolio with high growth potential, that may suit investors with a very high tolerance for risk. [DHHF](https://www.betashares.com.au/fund/diversified-all-growth-etf)

DHHF offers investors an extremely diverse option with holdings in approximately, 8000 securities. DHHF's 100% international share allocation makes it a less conservative investment when compared to similar alternatives such as [VDHG](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/products/en/detail/8221/Overview) which holds a 10% allocation to defensive asset classes. However, this doesn't mean investors can't roll their own defensive asset weightings by mixing in ETFs such as [IAF](https://www.blackrock.com/au/individual/products/251977/ishares-core-composite-bond-etf), [BOND](https://www.ssga.com/au/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-spasx-australian-bond-fund-bond) and [VIF](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/products/en/detail/8216/Overview). DHHF manages holdings in 4 underlying ETFs being A200, VTI, SPDW and SPEM offering equal exposure to the US and Australian markets and slightly less to both developed and emerging global markets. Underlying ETF fees are rebated into the fund.

**Benefits**

- Simplifies international equity investment
- Low management fee
- No double-dipping on management costs
- Extremely diverse covering both developed and emerging markets

**Drawbacks**

- Lacks defensive assets
- Lacks fine-grain control
- Immature
